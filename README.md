# NCrontab Advanced

**NOTE - this is still in development, and hasn't been fully unit tested.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

We were looking to implement [NCrontab](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab) for a project, but found it had a few shortcomings:
* No support for #, L and W
* Only supported one cron format:  "MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK"

So, I started looking into adding these features.  After some digging through the code, it became apparent that while the code worked well for the cron strings that it supported, it wouldn't scale well for support of #, L and W. :-(

In comes NCrontab-Advanced - a complete re-write of the parsing engine.  Along with the re-write come the following features:

**Timeouts**
Ever try to get the next instance of a date from a cron string that has no next instance?  Now you can specify a timeout in milliseconds before GetNextOccurence times out and throws an exception.

**Support for the following cron formats:**
* `CronStringFormat.Default`: MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK
* `CronStringFormat.WithYears`: MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK YEARS
* `CronStringFormat.WithSeconds`: SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK
* `CronStringFormat.WithSecondsAndYears`: SECONDS MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK YEARS


**Support for the following cron expressions:**

```
Field name   | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters
------------------------------------------------------------
Minutes      | 0-59            | * , - /
Hours        | 0-23            | * , - /
Day of month | 1-31            | * , - / L W
Month        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * , - /
Day of week  | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * , - / L #
Year         | 1970â€“2099       | * , - /
```

Instructions for using these expressions are on the [Cron Expresssions page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression).
